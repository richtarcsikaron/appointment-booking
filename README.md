**Appointment-booking**

A short UiPath Process for appointment bookings for an occupational medicine clinic in  onlineorvosok.hu

* The process was active for a short period, because the site got this feature after a couple of months, so I had permission to publish the process
* The screenshots are deleted for privacy reasons


### How It Works ###

1. The config file must be upgraded with the orchestrator process, folder, and asset names.
2. The process uses the Edge browser.
3. There is no Queue set up, the Transaction Items are stored only in a datatable filled up from the data scraping from the site.
